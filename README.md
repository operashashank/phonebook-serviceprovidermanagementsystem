Hello programmers! I am Shashank Savarkar, B.Tech student pursuing his major in Civil Engineering(Rail Specilazation) from Gati Shakti Vishwavidyalaya(GSV-Vadodara) formarly known as National Rail and Transporation Institute(NRTI-Vadodara).
So here I've uploaded the source code of the 1st sem project of computer programming course. In this I've created a program which handles contact details and service provider like Airtel, JIO, VI etc. Here I've used file handling t create different text files for each sevice provider to manipulate data. Also I've created various functions to tackle operations like add contact, view contact, search contact, edit/update contact, porting number from one service provider to another one etc.
Also I've attached the PPT that helped while presenting the project.
At the end I want to express my gratitude to all the people who helped a lot till the completion of this project,* especially ***chatGPT***.
That's it from my side!
